vivid - Violet's inherently versatile Interpreter and Daemon

  Usage: vivid ($script|$folder|command) (arguments)

  Interpreter:
    In interpreter mode a single thread executes a single script. The vivid.conf next
    to the given script or folder will be loaded as configuration. If it does not exist
    the interpreter will fallback to the .vivid folder inside of the users home directory.
    The gui programming interface is only available in interpreter mode.

    Commands:
      vivid                                launch interactive REPL in current folder
      vivid [$folder]                      launch interactive REPL in specified $folder
      vivid [$script]                      run a single $script from path
      vivid dev [$script]                  develop a single $script with live reload

  Daemon:
    In daemon mode multiple threads execute the vivid scripts inside of the given workdir.
    The vivid.conf inside of the defined workdir will be loaded as configuration.

    Commands:
      vivid run [$workdir]                 run daemon in $workdir
      vivid install [$workdir] [$user]     install daemon service in $workdir running as $user
      vivid uninstall                      uninstall daemon service
      vivid start                          start deamon service
      vivid stop                           stop daemon service
      vivid restart                        restart daemon service
